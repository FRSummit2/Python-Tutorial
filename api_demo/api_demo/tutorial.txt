Before launching your server, to access your Admin Interface, you need to initiate the database
>> python manage.py migrate


syncdb will create necessary tables or collections depending on your db type, necessary for the admin interface to run. Even if you don't have a superuser, you will be prompted to create one.
If you already have a superuser or have forgotten it, you can always create one using the following code
>> python manage.py createsuperuser
